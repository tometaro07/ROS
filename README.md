If you are as lost as I was when I entered this class follow this guide

Getting Started
===========

1. Install the ros distribution that you want (preferebly ros kinetic http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu , with desktop-full)

2. Navigate to Home folder using:

            cd

3. Clone this repository (usually to clone a repository you do: git clone <git repository link>):

            git clone https://github.com/socrob/autonomous_systems.git
            
Whenever the repo is updated you can get the latest updates with:
        
            cd $HOME/autonomous_system
            git pull origin master
